"""Simple in-process scheduled jobs — stdlib only (threading + time), no
APScheduler/Celery/cron dependency, per the zero-pip-dependency constraint.

A single daemon thread wakes up every CHECK_INTERVAL seconds and runs
whichever registered jobs are due, tracking each job's next-run time in
memory (nothing persisted — a restart just resumes polling on the same
schedule, which is fine for jobs that check "is anything due?" against the
DB rather than relying on the scheduler itself to remember what it did).
Good enough for a handful of low-frequency jobs in a single-worker,
single-tenant app (see Makefile: WORKERS=1); this is not a distributed job
queue, and running with WORKERS>1 would run one of these threads per
worker process — harmless for something idempotent, but a reminder could
theoretically be picked up by two workers in the same poll window and
emailed twice. Not a concern at the default WORKERS=1.

The one job registered today is `_run_due_reminders`, which fires Reminders
created via Ask AI/MCP's create_reminder tool (see ai.py) once their
remind_at has passed: it creates an in-app Notification and emails the
reminder's owner, then marks it sent so the next poll skips it.
