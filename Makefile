# Dev server. `make` (or `make run`) starts gunicorn with autoreload (picks
# up .py file changes; template/static edits already show up on the next
# request without a restart, via app.py's DEBUG flag — see app.py) and a
# worker restart every 1000 requests processed, to shake off any slow memory
# growth in a long-lived dev session. Same shape of command a provisioned
# instance runs under (see ../admin/launcher/provisioner.py), just invoked
# locally instead of by the launcher.

# Package a ready-to-run copy of this app for the landing page's "Buy Once"
# button (../admin/routes/downloads.py serves the result) — the whole
# directory, seeded app.db included, so unzip-and-run shows the demo company
# immediately. .env is excluded: it's gitignored and per-install already
# (see .env.example) — without one, utils.py falls back to its documented
# dev SECRET_KEY, same as a fresh git clone. WAL sidecar files are excluded
# too: they're SQLite's in-flight journal, not data, and get rebuilt from
# app.db the moment anything reopens it.
#
# dist/pro.zip is committed to git (see the `!dist/pro.zip` line in
# .gitignore) so Render's build has it without needing to run this target —
# re-run `make dist` and commit the new zip whenever this app's source
# changes, or the download button will silently keep serving the old code.
