# Dev server. `make` (or `make run`) starts gunicorn with autoreload (picks
# up .py file changes; template/static edits already show up on the next
# request without a restart, via app.py's DEBUG flag — see app.py) and a
# worker restart every 1000 requests processed, to shake off any slow memory
# growth in a long-lived dev session. Same shape of command a provisioned
# instance runs under (see ../admin/launcher/provisioner.py), just invoked
# locally instead of by the launcher.
#
# Migrations are NOT applied here — gunicorn workers importing app:app never
# reach its __main__ block (see app.py), so run `make db-migrate` first.
# `python3 app.py` (this app's own dev server, not this target) still
# auto-migrates on every run, same as before.

# company immediately. .env is excluded: it's gitignored and per-install
# already (see .env.example) — without one, utils.py falls back to its
# documented dev SECRET_KEY, same as a fresh git clone. WAL sidecar files
# are excluded too: they're SQLite's in-flight journal, not data, and get
# rebuilt from app.db the moment anything reopens it.
#
# dist/ is gitignored — ../admin/routes/downloads.py runs this target itself
# on the first production request for pro.zip and caches the result, so
# there's nothing to remember to rebuild/commit here.

# Full backup for disaster recovery / moving to a new host: the whole
# directory zipped up — including .env and uploads/, unlike `dist` above
# (a clean distributable that deliberately excludes both, see its own
# comment) — with a consistent point-in-time snapshot of app.db standing
# in for the live file. A plain `cp` of app.db isn't safe: it runs in WAL
# mode (see models.py), so a write in flight can leave committed data
# sitting in the app.db-wal sidecar rather than app.db itself, and a raw
# copy can grab the file mid-write in a torn state. backup.py drives
# sqlite3's own Online Backup API (stdlib, no extra install) instead,
# which is built for exactly this: safe to run against a live database.
#
# Written to backups/pro-<timestamp>.zip so repeated runs don't clobber
# each other; backups/ is gitignored, same as dist/.
