"""Peewee models for pro.

Single-tenant: there is no Workspace concept at all — one instance == one
customer.

Schema changes go through migrations/ (peewee-migrate — vendored, see
vendor/peewee_migrate/ and vendor/playhouse/, plus the note on Pro's own
dependency story in AGENTS.md), applied by run_migrations() at startup (see
the bottom of this file). This is pro's one deliberate divergence from
core's zero-pip-dependency, no-migrations-framework rule — see
AGENTS.md for why the tradeoff was worth it here and core stays as-is.

    Pragmas, and why each is here rather than left at SQLite's own default:
    - journal_mode=wal: readers (most requests) don't block on a writer,
      and vice versa — the default rollback journal takes an exclusive
      lock for the whole write.
    - synchronous=NORMAL: the pairing WAL mode's own docs recommend. Full
      durability on every commit (the FULL default) costs an fsync per
      write for a guarantee WAL already covers except across an actual OS
      crash/power loss — an acceptable trade for a single-tenant app.
    - foreign_keys=1: SQLite ignores FK constraints unless a connection
      turns this on itself; without it, on_delete="CASCADE"/"SET NULL" in
      models.py would be decoration, not enforced.
    - busy_timeout=5000: retry for up to 5s on a locked database instead of
      failing the request immediately. Single gunicorn worker or not (see
      ../Makefile), jobs.py's reminder-polling thread and a request handler
      both open their own connection to the same file, so brief contention
      between them is real, not hypothetical.
    - cache_size=-64000: a 64MB page cache (negative = KB, SQLite's own
      convention), up from the ~2MB default — cheap on a server built for
      this, and this database is read far more than it's written.
