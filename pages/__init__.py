"""Every route in the app, split by feature area. Still no blueprints —
each module below does `from app import app` and decorates its own routes
directly, exactly as a single flat pages.py used to; this package just
gives each feature area its own file once the flat version grew past a
size an editing pass could comfortably hold, while keeping the same "an
AI-editing tool needs to hold it all in context" idea at the grain of one
file per feature instead of one file per app.
